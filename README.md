# IBM Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing

Welcome to the repository for my course project **IBM Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing**, completed through Coursera. I've learned a lot about computer vision and image processing through this course, and I earned a certificate upon completion. This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks and files demonstrating the topics covered throughout the course.

## Course Highlights

The course covered a wide range of topics related to computer vision and image processing, including:

### Basic Image Processing
- **Working with Python Libraries (PIL & OpenCV):** Loading, manipulating, and saving images using PIL and OpenCV.
- **Geometric Transformations:** Resizing, cropping, and rotating images.
- **Histograms and Intensity Transformations:** Analyzing image histograms and implementing contrast stretching.

### Advanced Image Processing Techniques
- **Spatial Filtering:** Applying smoothing and sharpening filters to images.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Training and using SVM models for image classification.

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning in Computer Vision
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Training and using KNN models for classification.
- **Logistic Regression & Softmax Classification:** Implementing logistic regression with mini-batch gradient descent.
- **Neural Networks & Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** 
  - Building simple neural networks for binary classification.
  - Comparing ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions.
  - Using CNNs with PyTorch for image classification.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques to expand image datasets.

### Object Detection
- **Object Detection with Haar Cascades:** Detecting objects using Haar-like features.
- **Faster R-CNN:** Building a Faster R-CNN model for object detection.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `basic_image_processing/` - Notebooks covering the basics like PIL and OpenCV usage, geometric transformations, and histograms.
- `machine_learning/` - Notebooks on machine learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, and logistic regression.
- `deep_learning/` - Neural network and CNN implementations with data augmentation techniques.
- `object_detection/` - Object detection projects using Haar features and Faster R-CNN.
